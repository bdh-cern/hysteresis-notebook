'The' B-train is one of several magnetic measurement systems at several accelerators. Here we are concerned with the SPS B-train.

The system consists of two above-ground dipoles connected in parallel with the SPS dipoles such that they replicate the field given by the 'actual' dipoles at a given current. 

## Things to Note

- The B-train has a precision of about 1e-5 T.
- The operational B-train does not currently (05-02-26) have a NMR system for integration drift correction
	- Despite this, there is still an m1BCorrection field for the operational B-train
- If the FCGs are off, the usual B-train devices will publish simulated values instead of real measured ones.
- 'Bdot' is used to refer to $\dot{B}$, i.e. the rate of change of $B$ with time.
	- Bdot is really the only thing the RF team cares about because it drives the $\dot{p}$ during acceleration. Integration drift on the operational B-train is therefore irrelevant to them.
